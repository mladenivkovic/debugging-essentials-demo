Debugging Essentials Demo
-------------------------

Small demo programs to showcase what gdb and valgrind etc can do.

Instructions are inside each directory's README.

To compile the programs, you can either use the provided Makefiles by running
`make` inside the directory. The Makefiles use gcc to compile the programs.
Alternatively, you can compile them any way you prefer. Just don't forget to
pass the `-g` debugging flag to your compiler.

For a shorter demo (~1h with talk/lecture/slides), use README_SHORT.txt in
example directories.
The examples for the short version are:

- 01-gdb-basics
- 03-gdb-breakpoint-function
- 04-gdb-breakpoint-conditional
- 06-gdb-watchpoint
- 07-gdb-frames
- 08-gdb-segfault
- 09-gdb-core-dump
- 11-gdb-FPE
- 13-valgrind
- 14-address-sanitizer

Debugging Essentials Demo
=========================


Small demo programs to showcase what gdb and valgrind etc can do.

Each directory should contain at least the following files:

    - main.c
        main program file

    - Makefile
        a makefile for GNU's make system. 

    - INSTRUCTIONS.txt
        A list of instructions to follow along and use the examples,
        as intended for the live demo.
        This file may be missing if a file INSTRUCTIONS_SHORT.txt exists.
        This is the case for examples where the "short" version of the demo
        is identical to the "long" version.

    - DEMO_NOTES
        Shortened, uncommented version of instructions, intended for
        whoever is demonstrating the topic, not for attendees.


Some directories may contain additional files.
        
        

Instructions are inside each directory's `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` file.

To compile the programs, you can either use the provided Makefiles by running
`make` inside the directory. The Makefiles use gcc to compile the programs.
Alternatively, you can compile them any way you prefer. Just don't forget to
pass the `-g` debugging flag to your compiler.

For a shorter demo (~1h with talk/lecture/slides), use `INSTRUCTIONS_SHORT.txt` in
example directories.
The examples for the short version are:

- 01-gdb-basics
- 03-gdb-breakpoint-function
- 04-gdb-breakpoint-conditional
- 06-gdb-watchpoint
- 07-gdb-frames
- 08-gdb-segfault
- 09-gdb-core-dump
- 11-gdb-FPE
- 13-valgrind
- 14-address-sanitizer

10 GDB optimization
===========================

same as demo for gdb segfault backtrace, 
1) moved for loop into function
2) added optimization flag -O3

Show that values can be optimized out

Idea: Show that single function can have optimization turned off

#pragma GCC push_options
#pragma GCC optimize ("O0")

your code

#pragma GCC pop_options

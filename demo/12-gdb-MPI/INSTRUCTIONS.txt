12 GDB + MPI
========================


1   Look through the source code of the program.
    It's a very basic MPI program which will print a "Hello" from each rank and
    then sleep for 1s. Rank 2 should crash after 20s.

2   Don't forget to compile with the debug flags! Point them out on the compile
    command. To compile the code, run `make`, or the full compilation command
    manually, e.g.

        $ make

    or

        $ mpicc main.c -o exMPI -g -O0

3   Run the program:

        $ mpirun -n 4 ./exMPI

    Rank 2 should crash after 20s.

4   Run the program by attaching an `xterm` terminal emulator to each MPI rank,
    which will launch `exMPI` in gdb directly: (See contents of `run.sh`)

        $ mpirun -n 4 xterm -e gdb -ex run ./exMPI

    Now, we catch the error!

    NOTE: You may want to avoid using MPI_ABORT() while debugging.
    Depending on the implementation, it will instantly quit `xterm`
    instead of letting gdb handle the error.

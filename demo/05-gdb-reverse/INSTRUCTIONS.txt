05 Demo for gdb with reverse
==============================

1   Look through the source code of the program.

2   Don't forget to compile with the debug flags! Point them out on the compile
    command. To compile the code, run `make`, or the full compilation command
    manually, e.g.

        $ make

    or

        $ gcc main.c -o ex -g -lm -O0

    NOTE: we must turn off optimization for this to work. (-O0 flag)

3   run the program with gdb:

        $ gdb ./ex

4   Make breakpoint at main.c:6 and main.c:12

        (gdb) break main.c:6
        (gdb) break mainc:12

5   Run the program

        (gdb) run

6   Once the first breakpoint is hit, start recording and continue the run:

        (gdb) record
        (gdb) continue

7   Once the second breakpoint is hit, we can now walk the program back in reverse

7.1 Go back a single line:

        (gdb) reverse-step

7.2 Go back until start of recording:

        (gdb) reverse-continue

    You can still use `next` or `step` or `continue` to proceed forwards
    in time with the execution.
